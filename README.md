## Verilog-Blockly

Verilog-Blockly is a block-based environment for coding with Verilog. The project allows users to create Verilog code by dragging and dropping visual blocks, making it easier to learn and use.  

### Inputs

Verilog-Blockly takes user input in the form of blocks that represent various Verilog components, operators, and structures. These blocks can be dragged from the toolbox and connected to form a visual representation of the desired Verilog code.

### Outputs

Verilog-Blockly generates Verilog code as output. The generated code can be viewed in a separate pane and can be copied or exported for use in Verilog simulation or synthesis tools.
